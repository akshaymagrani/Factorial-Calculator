Task 2: Factorial Calculator

Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).

Requirements:

    Use Scanner to accept input from the user.
    Ensure the program handles both valid and invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers).
    Calculate the factorial using a for loop.
    Display an appropriate message if the user enters a negative number.
